# Curriculum Learning for Recovery Training

## Context

Recovery training (`ppo_recover.py`) samples initial states from fixed ranges for v, beta, r, and yaw. This makes early training inefficient — the agent faces states it cannot yet handle. Curriculum learning starts with narrow ranges and expands them as the agent demonstrates competence, measured by a rolling success rate from `info["recovered"]`.

## Approach

Custom SB3 `BaseCallback` that tracks rolling episode success rate. When success rate >= 80% over a 500-episode window, all four ranges expand simultaneously by fixed increments. Uses `env_method()` to push updated ranges to **all** SubprocVecEnv subprocess environments at once — every subprocess moves to the next stage together.

### Curriculum stages

All four ranges expand in lockstep. The user specifies `n_stages` (number of expansions). Each range is defined by initial `[lo, hi]` and max `[lo, hi]`. A single increment per range is **derived**:

```
increment = (max_hi - initial_hi) / n_stages
```

At each expansion: `lo -= increment`, `hi += increment`. After `n_stages` expansions all ranges reach their max values exactly. This requires that lo and hi expand by equal amounts (i.e. `initial_lo - max_lo == max_hi - initial_hi` for each range), which holds for all four ranges by design.

With default config (`n_stages=6`):

| Stage | v | beta | r | yaw |
|-------|---|------|---|-----|
| 0 | [5.0, 9.0] | [-0.10, +0.10] | [-0.20, +0.20] | [-0.20, +0.20] |
| 1 | [4.5, 9.5] | [-0.14, +0.14] | [-0.30, +0.30] | [-0.30, +0.30] |
| 2 | [4.0, 10.0] | [-0.18, +0.18] | [-0.40, +0.40] | [-0.40, +0.40] |
| 3 | [3.5, 10.5] | [-0.22, +0.22] | [-0.50, +0.50] | [-0.50, +0.50] |
| 4 | [3.0, 11.0] | [-0.27, +0.27] | [-0.60, +0.60] | [-0.60, +0.60] |
| 5 | [2.5, 11.5] | [-0.31, +0.31] | [-0.69, +0.69] | [-0.69, +0.69] |
| 6 | [2.0, 12.0] | [-0.35, +0.35] | [-0.79, +0.79] | [-0.79, +0.79] |

### Stopping condition

Expansion stops after `n_stages` expansions, at which point all ranges have reached their max values simultaneously. After that, the callback continues to log metrics but no longer modifies ranges. Training itself continues until `total_timesteps` is reached — the curriculum only controls range expansion, not training termination.

### `num_timesteps` vs `n_calls`

SB3's `_on_step()` fires once per `env.step()` call, but with `n_envs` parallel environments each call advances `n_envs` timesteps. Two counters exist:

- **`self.n_calls`**: number of times `_on_step()` was called (= number of `env.step()` calls)
- **`self.num_timesteps`**: total environment steps = `n_calls * n_envs`

The callback uses **`self.num_timesteps`** for both `log_freq` and `max_curriculum_timestep` comparisons, so these thresholds behave consistently regardless of `n_envs`. The `min_episodes_between_expansions` hysteresis uses an episode counter (not timesteps) and is unaffected.

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `train/callbacks.py` | **New file** — `CurriculumRange` dataclass, `CurriculumLearningCallback`, `make_curriculum_callback()` factory |
| `f1tenth_gym/envs/f110_env.py` | Add `set_recovery_ranges()` method (~8 lines, after `_get_recovery_reward` at ~line 1122) |
| `train/config/gym_config.yaml` | Add `curriculum:` section with all tuning knobs |
| `train/config/env_config.py` | Load `CURRICULUM_CONFIG`, add `get_curriculum_config()` |
| `train/train_common.py` | Wire curriculum callback into `train()` and `continue_training()` callback lists |

## [X] Step 1: Add setter method to F110Env

**File:** `f1tenth_gym/envs/f110_env.py` (~line 1124)

`set_recovery_ranges(self, v_range, beta_range, r_range, yaw_range)` — already implemented. Sets the four `self.recovery_*_range` attributes. Called via `SubprocVecEnv.env_method()` which uses `get_wrapper_attr` to traverse the Monitor wrapper.

## [X] Step 2: Create `train/callbacks.py`

### `CurriculumRange` dataclass
- Uniform representation: every range is `[lo, hi]`
- Fields: `initial_lo`, `initial_hi`, `max_lo`, `max_hi`, `increment` (derived), `current_lo`, `current_hi` (runtime state)
- Constructor computes `increment = (max_hi - initial_hi) / n_stages` and validates `initial_lo - max_lo == max_hi - initial_hi`
- Methods: `expand()` → applies `lo -= increment`, `hi += increment`, clamps to max, returns bool if changed; `get_range()` → `[lo, hi]`; `is_at_max()` → bool

### `CurriculumLearningCallback(BaseCallback)`

Constructor params:
- 4x `CurriculumRange` configs (v, beta, r, yaw)
- `window_size=500` — rolling success window size
- `success_threshold=0.8` — expansion trigger
- `min_episodes_between_expansions=1000` — hysteresis guard (must be >= `window_size`; constructor validates this)
- `max_curriculum_timestep=None` — stop expanding after N `num_timesteps` (None = no limit)
- Logging frequency reuses `CKPT_SAVE_FREQ` from `env_config.py` (same frequency as checkpoints and eval) — no separate param.

Key methods:
- **`_on_training_start()`**: Push initial (narrow) ranges to all envs via `env_method` (preferred over `_init_callback` — semantically correct as it runs "before the first rollout starts" when the training env is fully ready)
- **`_on_step()`**: Check `self.locals["dones"]` and `self.locals["infos"]` for completed episodes. When `dones[i]` is True, read `infos[i]["recovered"]` and append to rolling window. Check expansion conditions. Log periodically.
- **`_should_expand()`**: Returns True when: hysteresis satisfied AND success_rate >= threshold AND not past max_timestep AND `current_stage < n_stages`. No separate window-fullness check — since `min_episodes_between_expansions >= window_size` (enforced in constructor), the window is guaranteed full when hysteresis passes.
- **`_expand_ranges()`**: Call `expand()` on each range, clear window (agent must re-prove competence), reset episode counter, push new ranges to envs, log to wandb
- **`_push_ranges_to_envs()`**: `self.training_env.env_method("set_recovery_ranges", v, beta, r, yaw)`
- **`_log_metrics()`**: Log `curriculum/success_rate`, `curriculum/expansion_count`, `curriculum/stage`, per-range `curriculum/{name}_lo` and `curriculum/{name}_hi` via `wandb.log()`. Log using `step=self.num_timesteps` so curriculum metrics align with `eval/mean_reward` on the same wandb x-axis — this makes it easy to identify which stage produced the best model.

### `make_curriculum_callback(config: dict)` factory
- Returns `None` if `config.get("enabled")` is False
- Builds `CurriculumRange` objects from config dict
- Only forwards optional keys (`window_size`, `success_threshold`, etc.) that are present in the config dict. Missing keys are omitted from the constructor call, so `__init__` defaults apply. This keeps defaults in a single place (the constructor signature) rather than duplicating them in both `__init__` and the factory's `config.get()` calls.
- Returns configured `CurriculumLearningCallback`

## [X] Step 3: Add curriculum config to `gym_config.yaml`

Appended to recovery section. No `log_freq` — reuses `CKPT_SAVE_FREQ`.

```yaml
curriculum:
  enabled: true
  n_stages: 6
  window_size: 500
  success_threshold: 0.8
  min_episodes_between_expansions: 1000
  max_curriculum_timestep: null
  # Each range: [initial_lo, initial_hi, max_lo, max_hi]
  v_range:    [5.0, 9.0, 2.0, 12.0]
  beta_range: [-0.10, 0.10, -0.349, 0.349]
  r_range:    [-0.20, 0.20, -0.785, 0.785]
  yaw_range:  [-0.20, 0.20, -0.785, 0.785]
```

## [X] Step 4: Load config in `env_config.py`

After `RECOVERY_TRACK_POOL` (line 77):
- Add `CURRICULUM_CONFIG = _config.get("curriculum", {})`
- Add `get_curriculum_config()` function that returns `CURRICULUM_CONFIG`

## [X] Step 5: Wire into `train_common.py`

In both `train()` (~line 84) and `continue_training()` (~line 198):
- Import `make_curriculum_callback` from `train.callbacks` and `get_curriculum_config` from `train.config.env_config`
- Build callbacks list, conditionally append curriculum callback if `make_curriculum_callback()` returns non-None
- Save curriculum config to YAML alongside gym config

## Verification

1. **Unit tests**: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_curriculum_callback.py` — tests CurriculumRange expansion, validation, factory, and hysteresis constraint.
2. **Smoke test**: Run `python train/ppo_recover.py --m t` with `total_timesteps` temporarily set to ~500k. Verify console prints show expansion events with updated ranges.
3. **Wandb check**: Confirm `curriculum/*` metrics appear on the wandb dashboard.
4. **Disabled mode**: Set `curriculum.enabled: false` in YAML, run training, verify no curriculum output and training proceeds normally.
5. **Max cap**: Set very small max ranges (equal to initial), verify no expansions trigger.
6. **Existing tests**: Run `python3 -m pytest` to confirm no regressions (the env change is additive-only).
