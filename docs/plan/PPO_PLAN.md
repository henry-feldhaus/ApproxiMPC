# PPO Implementation Plan

To train my drifting controller, I am planning to use **PPO** from SB3 with `wandb` and `tensorboard` integration for model training visualization, and model saving.

## Core functionality

### Overview

Implement training script `train/train_ppo_drift.py` that uses PPO from SB3 to implement a controller that learns how to drift around a track.

### Tasks

| Status | Task |
|----|----|
| [ ] |  Time step is 0.05s → *currently behaving erratically for timestep !+ `0.01`*|
| [ ] |  Parallelized with 400 simulated instances running concurrently → *currently crashing with more than ~150 envs* |
| [ ] |  Unit testing suite |
| [X] |  PPO from SB3 |
| [X] |  Each rollout consists of 1024 steps |
| [X] |  Correct reset config `cl_random_static` (`cl_random_random` also works) |
| [X] |  Training with batch size of 1024 |
| [X] |  Sum of discounted reward is calculated with discount factor gamma=0.99 |
| [X] |  Learning rate decays from `1 x 10^{-3}` to `1 x 10^-4` over the course of training |
| [X] |  120 million time steps |
| [X] |  Actor and critic networks implemented as MLPs |
| [X] |  Actor has 2 hidden layers of 256 neurons |
| [X] |  Critic has two hidden layers of 512 neurons |
| [X] |  Both actor, critic networks use Leaky Rectified Linear Unit activation function with negative slope of 0.2 |

## Code organization and debugging

### Overview

1. Train with a single command

    ```bash
    python training/train_ppo_drift.py
    ```

2. Import environment from a single source of truth in `training/env_config.py`
3. Directories clearly organized
4. Live visualization with **wandb** live metrics and videos, and **tensorboard**

### Tasks

| Status | Task |
|------|-------|
| [ ] | Integration with **wandb** video recording with `monitor_gym=True` to debug training, recording only samples of training to save memory space |
| [ ] | Enable early stopping with reward plateau detection → `from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import StopTrainingOnNoModelImprovement`|
| [ ] | Best model tracking with evaluation callback |
| [ ] | Create a separate evaluation environment for periodic evaluation of the current policy with full episodes, → `from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import EvalCallback`|
| [X] | Save config params with `wandb.init(config={..})` to save params for comparison |
| [X] | Save training config as `config.json` alongside each model |
| [X] | Resume capability from checkpoint|
| [X] | Enable the callback for wandb for better integration → `from wandb.integration.sb3 import WandbCallback` |
| [X] | Periodic checkpoint saving → `from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import CheckpointCallback` |
| [X] | Live visualization of training, including key RL metrics such as reward convergence, and NN metrics like `policy_loss` and `value_loss` |
| [X] | Integration with **tensorboard** with `sync_tensorboard=True` |
| [X] | Organized file structure for training, outputs, and **wandb** auto-generated outputs (see below) |
| [X] | `.gitignore` to exclude output directories|
| [X] | Centralized environment config (see below) |
